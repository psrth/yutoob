A tethical way to use YouTube. No distractions, no ads, low memory + energy usage, and no clickbait aimed to take you on a night-long bender on the *Top 10 Mysteries Russia Doesn't Want You To Know.*

## Pre-emptive FAQs

### What are tethics?
> My message invigorates me. For too long, these large tech companies have harvested our data, they have violated our privacy, they have tracked our every move. Starting today, I will be asking prominent members of the tech community to sign their name onto this. A code of conduct, authored by me, that pledges them to a universal ethos, which I created, that I call, "tech ethics," or, "tethics" for short.
